/**
 * React components are styled very similarly to how you would natively style
 * an HTML element. You have two options: CSS classes and inline styles. These
 * styles are passed into a component by using props as we just learned about.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  ```
 *  ReactDOM.render(<input className="form-control"/>, container);
 *  ```
 *
 * You may have noticed that the prop name is `className` as opposed to `class`.
 * This is to avoid conflicts with the reserved word `class` in JavaScript.
 * Using the `className` property will apply the given CSS class to the element.
 *
 * As mentioned you can also use inline styles. This approach allows you to set
 * styles directly to an element without using CSS classes, but rather by
 * defining them as an object.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  ```
 *  ReactDOM.render(
 *    <input style={{
 *      border: '1px solid #000',
 *      fontSize: 18,
 *      width: 150
 *    }} />, container
 *  );
 *  ```
 *
 * When using inline styles CSS property names that contain a hyphen shohuld be
 * converted to camel case (e.g., font-size -> fontSize). Also by default any
 * property that has a numeric value will be assumed to have a unit of `px`.
 *
 * Exercise:
 *
 *  Create a `Box` component that renders a `div` and accepts a `size` and
 *  `style` property. Some CSS classes are provided:
 *
 *    - Box: provides basic styling for the component
 *    - Box--large: renders a large box
 *    - Box--medium: renders a medium box
 *    - Box--small: renders a small box
 *
 *  If the `size` is `large` the component should use the class `Box--large`.
 *  It should also use whatever inline styles are provided.
 *
 *  Make sure you get warnings if you provide the component with an invalid value for `size`

 *
 *  Tip! pass composed strings to a component like this:
 *  <MyComponent myProp={`Clave has ${nrOfConsultants} consultants`} />
